## Bugs

Solved bugs,

In mobile and tab responsive images, the text content does not align within the box
As a result of setting the box height size in media screen, I discovered this 

@media only screen and (max-width: 1000px)

•Adding the query and fixed the issue Responsiveness

I checked the website's responsiveness using Google Chrome Dev Tools. Mobile, tablet and desktop sizes were tested, and all worked well. It also responded on each breakpoint that were set up on Media Query's and no visual or functional errors found

## Version Control

•	GitHub

•	Gitpod

Gitpod served as the local repository and IDE. GitHUb served as the remote repository.

The following steps were followed to maintain version control;

•	I created a repository on GitHub and named it 'anthony-yoga-center'

•	I then signed in to Gitpod and opened a new workspace via the repository name 'anthony-yoga-center'

•	I created the pages, folders and files on GitPod

•	I saved my work on GitPod at regular intervals and pushed it to GitHub to keep it safe
This is the process I followed having completing each significant section of code, I typed the following into the terminal:

•	git add . (This added the work to git)

•	git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" (This committed the work)

•	git push (This pushed the work to GitHub)

## Deployment

•	The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

o	In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

o	From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

o	Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
